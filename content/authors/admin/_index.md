Hola! My name **is Anxiang (Adam) Zhang**, a master student in Carnegie Mellon,
specializing in NLP and Deep learning. I'm currently looking for **PhD opportunities in Fall 2021.**.

My ultimate research goal is to use a combination of AI technologies to distill
knowledge from different sources of data, i.e., images, language,
audio. People live in a multi-model world and automatical knowledge mining from
cross-modality data could help people deeply understand and easily explore
information, uncover hidden insights, and find relationships and patterns at
scale.

I'm currently TAing in [Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/)'s
[Introduction To Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F20/index.html)
course. Also, I'm working on a sound detection project with him, an extented
project on [NELS](http://nels.cs.cmu.edu/overview/)

Prior to this, I had a Bachelor in Economics( :flushed: ) in [Research Institute
of Economics and Management](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/RESEARCH.htm) of
Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, where I worked with Yu Zhao on
Knowledge Graph completion and published this paper as first co-author in ACL
2020. 

Besides, I'm also a mixed background student who has wide interests in economics and quantitative trading and playing Texas hold 'em.
