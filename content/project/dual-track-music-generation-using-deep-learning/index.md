1) Propose a novel dual-track architecture for generating classical piano music, which is able to model the inter-dependency of left-hand and right-hand piano music. 

2) Experimented with a lot of different models of neural network as well as different representations of music

3) Experimented some special policies for model training and generation, which contributed to the model performance remarkably.
